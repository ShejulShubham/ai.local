# ✅ Fixes to Try:

Check logs for open-webui to see why it's unhealthy:

bash
Copy
Edit
`docker logs open-webui`
Wait and retry — if the frontend takes time to boot up, it may recover and become healthy.

Temporarily test proxy manually from inside the Nginx container:

bash
Copy
Edit
`docker exec -it nginx-proxy apk add curl`
`docker exec -it nginx-proxy curl http://open-webui:8080`
If this fails, it confirms the Nginx container cannot reach open-webui.

docker start

```
sudo service docker start
```
